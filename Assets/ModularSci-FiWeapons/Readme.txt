Thank you for your purchase.

These weapons will also look great if used in conjunction with:
-Ultimate Spaceships Creator: http://u3d.as/J0F 
-Space Staions Creator: http://u3d.as/1ogP

Build Your Own Weapons
You can build your own weapons by quickly modifying the examples located in the Examples scene. In addition, you can also assemble your own weapons from scratch by opening up the modules scene and moving/rotating/scaling and duplicating the modules until you have something you are happy with.

Unified Materials
The materials listed under unified can be used to match the material of our other spaceships in the Ultimate Spaceships Creator or Space Stations Creator.

Changing Colors
If all of the included materials in this pack are not enough, you can feel free to modify the included Substance Painter file and export new textures for the modular parts, or to use the "mask" texture with the neutral color texture to change color in Photoshop or with script.

We didn't include the Substance Painter files for the missiles and mines because their textures are quite simple and the masks should be more than enough for all your needs. In addition adding them will make it a challenge to download and update this pack.
